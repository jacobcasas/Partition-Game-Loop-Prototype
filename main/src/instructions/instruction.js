        <p> 
            The purpose of this logic test is to get feedback on balance, mechanics, and ideas of this game to inch
            the games core loop to be playable. This test isn't intended to have any final or complete designs, 
            whether it be art or game logic. This is a study meant to tweak and narrow down grey ideas. 
        </p>
        <h2>What is your job?</h2>
        <p>
            Well, to play the game! Think of ideas that would be a good idea. Although, these ideas should not be any
            visual design ideas. Rather, I believe you should think about good cards, or gameplay additions that seem to
            fit in with the core idea.

        <p>Thank you for your help, now lets get started!</p>
